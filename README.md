# Gavin H Phill's Web Developer Portfolio    

## https://carpegavin.github.io/Gavs-Super-Big-Fun-Time-Portfolio/.

## The goal of this project was to create a responsive personal portfolio to showcase completed projects/applications to prospective employers.

## The requirments to develop my portfolio were as follows:
  * The front page must have the following visible
    1. name
    2. recent photo
    3. links to bio, projects, and contact info
    
  * The links must be clickable and navigate to the corresponding section of the site
  * The projects must be navigable to and titled
  * The project's images should grow in size to be larger than the others when focused upon.
  * When a project is clicked, the user is taken to the deployed app
  * The page must be responsive and adapt to various screens and devices.
  
## To acheive what was required, I did the following:
  * Using HTML and CSS and a very small amount of JavaScript I did the following:
    1. Researched dozens of portfolio examples online.
    2. Pseudo-coded a website layout on my whiteboard.
    3. Coded with A LOT of CSS
